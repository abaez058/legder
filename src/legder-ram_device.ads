--  A block device in memory, with crash injection.
--
--  This is the test double for every other device. Besides Read /
--  Write / Sync it can simulate the fault model the log is designed
--  for:
--    * Tear_Next_Write: the next Write lands with its second half
--      replaced by garbage, as a power loss mid-block would leave it.
--    * Drop_Unsynced: forget every Write since the last Sync, as a
--      power loss between Write and Sync would.
--  The showcase and the tests use these to check that Open recovers
--  exactly the committed prefix. A real device gets neither.
